# COVID-19 Visual Dashboard — Upgraded

This project contains an enhanced Streamlit dashboard with gradient background, floating orbs, cards, and Plotly charts.
It will work out-of-the-box using the bundled sample data. If you want to use the **real OWID dataset**, place it at:

    data/raw/owid-covid-data.csv

then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python src/clean.py
    streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

Enjoy the visuals ✨
